A collection of cybersecurity best practices for web3 projects

Feel free to submit a PR to contribute best practices - this is a living document to consolidate best practices for both individuals, like investors and developers, and enterprise organizations operating web3 environments. 

# Consumer

Communication
- It's vital to only purchase hardware wallets from official websites, i.e. Trezor's Wallet from https://trezor.io/
- It's equally vital to download software from official websites

Wallets
- Hardware wallets, like Trezor, should be used to store private keys on a device which can be secured and disconnected from the user's daily computer
- Wallet backup keys should be written on a piece of paper, and saved in a secure location

Physical security
- Hardware wallets can be saved in a user's home or a 3rd party location like a bank's security box
- Backup codes should be physically secured in a vault or other locked environment

# Enterprise

Team
- Trusted security team should be vetted through background checks, interviews with family and friends
- Private keys which hold user data should have their seed phrase split using Shamir's sharing strategy, each backup needs to be secured in a location which is monitored, observed and secured
